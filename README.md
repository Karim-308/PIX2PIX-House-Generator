# House2Real: Transform House Outlines Into Realistic Images

## Project Description
House2Real leverages deep learning to transform simple sketches of house outlines into detailed, realistic images. This project is particularly useful for architects, real estate developers, and urban planners. It is developed in a Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive way to understand the data processing, model building, and output generation.

### Key Features
- **Photorealistic Generation**: Turn architectural outlines into lifelike house images.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Directly interact with the data and model predictions within the Jupyter Notebook.
- **Educational Tool**: Serve as a resource for students and professionals wanting to learn about the application of GANs in real estate and architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed, which can be done through Anaconda or directly with pip:
```bash
pip install notebook
```
## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
